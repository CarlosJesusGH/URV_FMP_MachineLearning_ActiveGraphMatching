# URV_FMP_MachineLearning_ActiveGraphMatching

Abstract: Given two graphs, the aim of graph matching is to find the “best” mapping between  nodes of one graph and nodes of the other graph. This mapping depends on some  parameters that usually are manually tuned in a trial and error method.  The aim of this master thesis is to propose a method to perform active graph  matching in which an active module queries one of the nodes of the graphs and the  oracle (human or artificial) returns the node of the other graph it has to be  mapped with. Then, the interactive module influences on the input parameters of  the graph-matching algorithm to automatically learn them. The new activeinteractive algorithm has to reach the matching desired by the user in few  interactions, since by imposing a node-to-node mapping, other ones have to be  automatically amended.
